### APB

Introduction
The Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) is part of the Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) protocol family. It defines a low-cost interface that is optimised for minimal power consumption and reduced interface complexity. The APB protocol is not pipelined, use it to connect to low-bandwidth peripherals that do not require the high performance of the AXI protocol.APB is a non pipelined structure.
